=== Overview ===
I wrote this game by following Clear Code's exremely clear tutorials. Thank you Clear Code!

tutorial links:
- Learning pygame by making Flappy Bird: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZg49z76cLw&list=PL8ui5HK3oSiF7ZFfwYokCD5myWYhGH24A&index=1

the assets are from Clear Code's github page here: https://github.com/clear-code-projects/FlappyBird_Python
and he got the graphics from here: https://github.com/samuelcust/flappy-bird-assets
and audio from here: https://www.sounds-resource.com/mobile/flappybird/sound/5309/

Overall
- it was fun and not difficult with the clear instructions. Again, thank you Clear Code!
- I felt satisfied when I got the game running
- I got to practice pygame and class

=== Some Custom Changes ===
I basically followed the logic of clear code
but I did tweek some details so they made more sense to me, so there are some differences, and here are a few noticible ones (that I remember):

- I wrote many class instead of using functions. I think this affects quite a lot. 
I wrote classes becuase I followed his tutorial on the snake game first. There he used classes and it made sense to me.
- I didn't scale the graphics, because my screen is tiny and I just used a smaller display screen.
