=== Overview ===
I wrote this game by following Clear Code's exremely clear tutorials. Thank you Clear Code!

tutorial links:
- Learning Pygame by making Pong: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf3-aDXG8q4
- Learning Pygame by making Pong Part 2: Adding the score and a countdown timer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Ih9mpn5tk
There are actually three parts to the tutorial, but I didn't do the last one

Overall
- it was fun and not difficult with the clear instructions. Again, thank you Clear Code!
- I felt satisfied when I got the game running
- I got to practice pygame and class

=== Some Custom Changes ===
I basically followed the logic of clear code
but I did tweek some details so they made more sense to me, so there are some differences, and here are a few noticible ones (that I remember):

- I wrote many class instead of using functions. I think this affects quite a lot. 
I remember Clear Code also mentioned in the tutorials more than onces that using functions requried too many global variables and he doesn't recommend it. He only wrote it that way because he didn't expect the game to get more complicated when he made the first tutorial.
But I actually started writing class since the first tutorial. Becuase I followed his tutorial on the snake game first. There he used classes and it made sense to me.
- I changed the colours so they resemble ping pong's ball, table, and racket. I used a different font I downloaded

=== Bugs ===
Here are some bugs I am aware of but haven't fixed yet.
Since I did tweek some code, and not just the one I listed above, these bugs may just exist in my code and not in Clear Code's original version

- the player's racket sometimes keeps going in one direction and can't be stopped.
- the ball can hit the top or bottom of the racket and bounce weirdly. I think Clear Code actually fixed this bug in the third tutorial, but I stopped at the second tutorial and moved on to a different game.
